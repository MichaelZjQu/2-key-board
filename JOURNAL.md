## 10/3/2025 - Brainstorm + Research  

New to hardware. I:
- read all the guides to get a general idea of the scope of a small project
- read the hackpad tutorial from the hackpad ysws 

As a result I:
- installed kicad 
- watched a tutorial on kicad
- started making my schematic

I also:
- installed Fusion360
- played around with it

## 10/10/2025 - Created Case + researched parts  

This time i:
- Made the case bottom
- Made the case top
- Researched where I'm gonna source my stuff

What went well:
- Making the case went pretty smoothly and was pretty fun
- Added some of my own design into the case

Struggles:
- Fusion on trackpad
- Researching parts and stuff, idk where to get some of this stuff im gonna ask in the slack, this is where most of my time went (like 3/4 of it)
