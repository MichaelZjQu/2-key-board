## 10/3/2025 - Brainstorm + Research  

New to hardware. I:
- read all the guides to get a general idea of the scope of a small project
- read the hackpad tutorial from the hackpad ysws 

As a result I:
- installed kicad 
- watched a tutorial on kicad
- started making my schematic

I also:
- installed Fusion360
- played around with it
